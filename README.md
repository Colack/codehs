# CodeHS

This is a simple repository full of all of my answers and solutions for codehs.
Use the repository at your own risk, because you are copying and pasting my code.



# How-to

The root folders contain the classes, for example, 'ap-computer-science' contains the answers for the ap computer science course.
The class folders contain all of the different sections, such as '1.1', or '2.2'.
So if you wanted to find the answers for '2.1.8', you would enter the '2.1' folder and use the 'pizza' files.

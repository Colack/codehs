# CodeHS

This project is for everyone who needs a bit of help with understanding the java programming language that is taught in the codehs courses.
it is meant to be used as a reference for your programming.
Please keep in mind that copying and pasting this code is a risk, so use this repository at your own expense.



# Notes

Some of the answers may not work in the future, due to the fact that codehs gets updated frequently. 
I will keep the repository up to date, but the answers may not work.



# How-to use

The root folders contain the classes, for example, 'ap-computer-science' contains the answers for the ap computer science course.
The class folders contain all of the different sections, such as '1.1', or '2.2'.
So if you wanted to find the answers for '2.1.8', you would enter the '2.1' folder and use the 'pizza' files.



# Contributions

You can contribute to this repository by working on fixing some of the errors that are found in the files, 
or by adding new files, or even new units.

Thanks for helping the next generation of programmers have a little boost!
